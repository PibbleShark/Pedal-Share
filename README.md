# Pedal-Share
 Website to allow guitar players to rent effects pedals from other players.  
 
 Website is currently a work in progress.  
 
 Users will create a profile.  They will then be able to post which guitar pedals they have in their collection.
 They will be able to set prices to rent those pedals.
 
 Other users will be able to browse those pedals and choose to rent those pedals.  
 They will be able to use the equipment for a designated amount of time.  Then they will return it to the owner.
 Each transaction will include a credit card hold for an amount specified by the owner which will be paid if 
 the equipment is not returned or if it is damaged.
